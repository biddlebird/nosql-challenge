# Overview
### Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will work with a NoSQL database containing data about food establishments across the UK. The goal is to perform various tasks, including setting up the database, updating records, and conducting exploratory data analysis to answer specific questions posed by the magazine "Eat Safe, Love." The analysis will help identify which establishments are safe to visit based on their ratings and hygiene scores.

The assignment is divided into three main parts:

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Import the data from a provided `establishments.json` file into a MongoDB database named `uk_food`.
   - Confirm that the data was loaded correctly by listing the databases, collections, and displaying sample documents.

2. **Database Update**:
   - Make specific updates to the database as requested by the magazine editors. This includes adding a new restaurant, updating its details, removing certain records, and ensuring that data types are correctly formatted.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Perform various queries and aggregations on the `establishments` collection to answer specific questions about food safety and ratings.
   - Tasks include identifying establishments with specific hygiene scores, finding the best-rated establishments in London, and analyzing the data to find the top local authorities with the best or worst hygiene records.

Throughout the assignment, you will use Python with libraries like PyMongo and Pandas to interact with the MongoDB database, perform data manipulations, and visualize the results. The completed analysis will provide valuable insights into food safety across different regions in the UK, helping the magazine make informed recommendations.

This assignment is a practical exercise in working with NoSQL databases, focusing on data manipulation, querying, and analysis using MongoDB.

# Importing Dependencies
```
from pymongo import MongoClient
from pprint import pprint
import pandas as pd
```

# Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
- Import the provided 'establishments.json' file into MongoDB using the terminal.
- Name the database 'uk_food' and the collection 'establishments'.
- Create an instance of the Mongo Client
- List the database in MongoDB to confirm that 'uk_food' is created with `print(mongo.list_database_names())`
- Verift that the 'establishments' collection exists within 'uk_food'
- Retrieve and display a document from the 'establishments' collection using 'find_one' and 'pprint'
```
# Import libraries
from pymongo import MongoClient
from pprint import pprint

# Create a MongoClient instance
mongo = MongoClient(port=27017)

# Assign the uk_food database to a variable
db = mongo['uk_food']

# Verify the database and collection
print(mongo.list_database_names())  # Should include 'uk_food'
print(db.list_collection_names())   # Should include 'establishments'

# Display a document from the collection
establishments = db['establishments']
document = establishments.find_one()
pprint(document)
```


# Part 2: Update the Database
- Add in the new restaurant: Insert the new restraunt, "Penang Flavours", into the 'establishments' collection with the provided information
- Find and Update BusinessTypeID: Locate the BusinessTypeID for "Restaurant/Cafe/Canteen". Update the "Penang Flavours" entry with the correct BusinessTypeID.
- Remove Dover establishments: count and remove all establishments associated with the Dover Local Authority. Confirm that the removal was successful.
- Data type correction: convert 'longitude' and 'latitude' fields from strings to decimal numbers. Convert the 'RatingValue' field from strings to intergers where applicable.

# Real-Life Applications and Data Analytics

This assignment showcases practical skills in managing and analyzing data within a NoSQL database, which is increasingly important in real-world scenarios. The techniques and concepts learned here can be directly applied to a wide range of real-life problems and data analytics tasks:

1. **Food Safety and Public Health**:
   - The ability to analyze and update food establishment data is crucial for health departments and regulatory agencies. By identifying patterns in hygiene scores and ratings, authorities can target inspections and resources more effectively, ensuring public safety.
   - For example, the insights gained from analyzing establishments with low hygiene scores can help prioritize which locations need immediate attention, potentially preventing foodborne illnesses.

2. **Customer Experience and Recommendation Systems**:
   - Businesses like food magazines, review platforms, and travel guides can use similar analytical methods to curate recommendations for their audiences. By focusing on highly-rated establishments with excellent hygiene scores, they can enhance customer satisfaction and trust.
   - This approach can also be extended to develop personalized recommendation systems that suggest the best dining options based on individual preferences and safety standards.

3. **Business Intelligence and Market Research**:
   - Companies can leverage the techniques from this assignment to gain insights into the competitive landscape. By analyzing the distribution of food establishment ratings and locations, businesses can identify market gaps, opportunities for expansion, and areas where they need to improve their services.
   - For instance, a restaurant chain might analyze the data to understand how their branches compare to competitors in terms of hygiene and customer satisfaction, helping them make data-driven decisions to improve their operations.

4. **Urban Planning and Public Services**:
   - Urban planners and local governments can use this type of analysis to assess the distribution of food establishments in different regions. Understanding where high and low-rated establishments are clustered can inform decisions about where to allocate resources, such as public health initiatives or community support programs.
   - This data-driven approach can also help in planning new commercial zones, ensuring that new developments meet safety and quality standards that align with community needs.

5. **Data-Driven Policy Making**:
   - Policymakers can utilize the insights from this analysis to create or adjust regulations governing food safety. By understanding the trends and patterns in food establishment ratings, they can craft more effective policies that encourage higher standards and better compliance among businesses.
